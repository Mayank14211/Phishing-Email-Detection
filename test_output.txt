2025-03-27 13:21:01.705505: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:210] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.
To enable the following instructions: SSE3 SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 AVX_VNNI FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
Some weights of the PyTorch model were not used when initializing the TF 2.0 model TFDistilBertModel: ['vocab_transform.weight', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_layer_norm.bias', 'vocab_projector.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing TFDistilBertModel from a PyTorch model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a TFBertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing TFDistilBertModel from a PyTorch model that you expect to be exactly identical (e.g. initializing a TFBertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
All the weights of TFDistilBertModel were initialized from the PyTorch model.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use TFDistilBertModel for predictions without further training.
